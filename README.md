    <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 16px;">
        Welcome to the interactive <strong>Chickens and Eggs</strong> model! This tool was designed by Robinson Salazar Rua and Peter Hovmand to help you understand the fascinating dynamics of a chicken population.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 16px;">
        In this model, you'll explore how different factors (such as fertility rate, death risk, and capacity level) affect the population of chickens in our virtual farm.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #856404; font-size: 18px;"> Your Tasks:</h3>
    <ul style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 16px;">
        <li><strong>Adjust the Parameters:</strong> Use the sliders to change the model initial conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe the Changes:</strong> Watch how these adjustments impact the chicken population over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Discover the Dynamics:</strong> Notice the feedback loops and delays that characterize this system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: #6c757d; font-size: 16px;">
        By playing with these parameters, you'll gain insights into the principles of system dynamics and understand how even simple systems can exhibit complex behaviors. Enjoy your journey into the world of chickens and eggs!
